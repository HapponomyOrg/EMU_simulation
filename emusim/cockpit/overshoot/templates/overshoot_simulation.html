            This simulation is based on data collected from the <a href="https://www.overshootday.org/">Overshoot day
            website</a>.<br>
            The graphs below show the overshoot in days. The number of days is calculated as follows:<br>
            First the number of days in the year is divided by the day of the year the overshoot happened to calculate
            the weight of a day in that year, in regards to resource consumption. If no overshoot happens then the
            overshoot day would be the 31st of December and the weight of a day would be 1. If the overshoot day would
            be in the middle of the year then the weight of a day would be 2.<br>Then the number of remaining days of
            that year, after the overshoot day, is calculated. This number is multiplied by the weight of a day and
            results in the number of 'normal resource use' overshoot days that have occurred that year. These are days
            in surplus of what the
            earth can generate for one year.<br>The cumulative graph shows the cumulative total number of overshoot
            days. Since the earth does not reset itself on the 1st of January we can also not reset the overshoot days.
